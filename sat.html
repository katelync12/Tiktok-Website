            <p class = "words">I got a 1550 on the SAT and completely self-studied. I only used two things. I used the Khan Academy SAT prep which gives you practice questions and customizes those questions based on your strengths and weaknesses. It's very helpful in working on specific skills and focusing on sections. You can also link it to your Collegeboard account and it'll take data from your past tests if you've taken them before. I also got a SAT book by Collegeboard from Amazon. I used this book for the 8 practice tests included which allowed me to simulate the SAT (as the one I took was on paper). With the new online SAT coming out, this may not be relevant much longer depending on when you taking the SAT.</p>

        <div class="row paragraph">
            <p class = "words">Not as much as it used to. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have gone test-optional, no longer requiring standardized tests like the SAT/ACT. However, it still doesn't hurt to take this exam. If you score well on it, you'll get a boost to your college application. If you don't score well on it, just don't submit your score. Note that some highly competitive schools like MIT still require the SAT, so if you're looking to apply to those kind of schools I would still highly recommend taking the SAT/ACT.</p>
